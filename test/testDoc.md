# Final Document

T[esting]{: id=testingSuffix} the reference of an ID within the same document.

{:newProj} was the name of an adequate product.

Why did I do all this? {:aTruth} If it renders, that's {:expression}. By the way, have you ever seen {:GHLink} ?

I like it when I eat a {:deliciousFood} _whilst_ wearing a {:warmItem}!

Wait, did you say *{:deliciousFood}*? Yes!

Also, I had a question about these items:

{:aNiceList}

And another list, without an attribute

{:aMeanList}

{:myPara}

Finished t{:testingSuffix}!
